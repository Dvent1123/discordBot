## Commands

#### Voting

Regular voting style that counts only the reactions from a specified role 
within a specified time limit set in seconds.

```http
  -voting <Guild ID/Name> <Specified Role> <Time Limit (secs)> <Question>
```

#### Majority

Majority voting based on a percentage of voters who are allowed to vote.

```http
  -majority #<Guild ID/Name> @<Specified Role> <Time Limit (secs)> <Percentage> <Question>
```

#### Conviction

Voting with an increase in weight of the member's vote over time if they keep their vote
cast for a longer period of time. The
increase will happen in the regular intervals based on what was specified. With 
the multiplier being a percent. 

```http
  -conviction #<Guild ID/Name> @<Specified Role> <Time Limit (secs)> <Intervals> <Multiplier (percent)> <Question>
```

#### Quadratic

Quadratic voting limits the number of reactions per member with the maximum reactions per user being 5 currently. 
They are allowed to pick from this set of reactions ['👍', '😀', '🤠','😗','😉']. Then tracks the number
of reactions members have given to an active proposal

```http
  -quadratic #<Guild ID/Name> @<Specified Role> <Reaction Limit> <Question>
```
